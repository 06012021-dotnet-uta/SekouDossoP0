            ArrayList

                It represents an ordered collection of an object that can be 
                indexed individually. It is basically an alternative to an array. 
                However, unlike array you can add and remove items from a list at 
                a specified position using an index and the array resizes itself 
                automatically. It also allows dynamic memory allocation, adding, 
                searching and sorting items in the list.
