            HashTable
                The Hashtable class represents a collection of key-and-value pairs 
                    that are organized based on the hash code of the key. It uses the 
                    key to access the elements in the collection.
                A hash table is used when you need to access elements by using key, 
                    and you can identify a useful key value. Each item in the hash table 
                    has a key/value pair. The key is used to access the items in the 
                    collection.
